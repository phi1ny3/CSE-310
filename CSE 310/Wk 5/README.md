# Overview
---
Using the Programming Language R, we analyze the sentimentality of language used throughout the book "Pride and Prejudice" by Jane Austen, and make a word cloud to convey the most popular words and their positive and negative connotation!

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}
* Could potentially take any text file, and use the dictionary to analyze the sentiment in it!
