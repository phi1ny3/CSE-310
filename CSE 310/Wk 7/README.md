# Overview
---
Using the Android Studio IDE, we create an app that lets us communicate through text across Bluetooth, without the need for data or internet access!


# Development Environment
---
There is only two tools that you need, and that's the Android Studio IDE.  The other is the hard part.  You have to change your settings gradle to use ":myappname", and you need to retrograde your JDK to JDK 8.

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}
* I'm honestly not sure how to improve this app's functionality.  It's more simple and limited than I thought.  Though funnily enough, finding the right settings and making sure the right JDK was the hardest part, I couldn't even get the app to run for the longest time.  Now I got it to work!  Make sure compatibility with AMD is on if your device uses their processors.
